  <br/>Directions:  There are 4 AJAX interactions. 1) When loading the page, all items are pulled from the DB. Scroll down to the bottom and it will load more from the database. 2) When you click on an item, it will use AJAX syncronous call in order to grab extra information about the item and display it. 3) When you type in the search box, the database will be searched and will return suggestions. 4) When you click on the suggestion, then the db will return a feed of all of all of those posts. There are only 30 unique posts repeated almost 20 times, so the db is returning unique posts, it will just look exactly alike.</p>

	</br>New plugin is a Google Image Search API. On the Post page, if you type something in 'Pictures: Option 3' and click 'Go', a Image Slider will appear with all the images of those search. I have not yet implemented saving the images to the server but that will be done by next lab. I also used multiple plugins to view the images, but that code was retrieved from a template site and I just did slight modifications on that code.</p>
